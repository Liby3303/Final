  <p class="football"> Joe Burrow has had one of the best seasons ever seen in college football. He continues to break records every game he steps on the field.</p>
  <p class="football"> He has become an instant icon for not just LSU but all of college football. He has clearly cemented his place in the College Football Pantheon.</p>
  <p class="football"> He has also had in my opinion he has had the biggest turn around season from the year before. This can bee seen when comparing his junior year and senior years stats:</p>
